					<h2><a name="whatIs" class="anchorLink">What is J.E.D.I.?</a></h2>
					<p>J.E.D.I. stands for Jisp Editor Directly on Internet. Jisp files are the ones used in <a href="http://www.jabber.org">Jabber</a> for packages containing emoticons (those, generally, adorable yellowish little faces that appear instead of text such as :-) ).</p>
					<p>J.E.D.I. is a server where jisp files are stored and you can download them. But, before downloading, you can customize them. That is, you can add or remove icons and change the text and the objects in an icon.</p>
					<p>Ok, excited about it? Well, before begin to dance around your table to celebrate that such thing exists, there is something you must know. Not all the <a href="http://www.jabber.org/software/clients.shtml">Jabber clients</a> support jisp files. In fact, I can assure you that they work with Psi. But I don't know more clients supporting it. If you now another and can provide instructions to install the packages in it, please take a look at the <a href="#contributing">Contributing to J.E.D.I.</a> section.</p>

				<div class="section">
					<h2><a name="using" class="anchorLink">Using J.E.D.I.</a></h2>
					<p>If you're willing to give J.E.D.I. a try, you can choose between two "flavours" of it.</p>
					<p>The first of them will likely work in every browser. It is a XHTML interface. That means that it is simply a webpage.<br/>
					<span class="runJEDI"><a href="MainView.do?transform=html"><strong>Run XHTML version</strong></a></span></p>
					<p>The second of them will work only on XUL enabled browsers, such as <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/start/">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/">SeaMonkey</a>. The difference with the first version is that this one is more powerful and seems like a desktop application.<br/>
					<span class="runJEDI"><a href="javascript:launchXULJEDI();"><strong>Run J.E.D.I.'s XUL Interface in its own window</strong></a></span></p>
					<p>Please note that, in both cases, if your session expires (that is, if you spend more than 10 minutes not doing any action in the application) you'll have to start over again editing your package from the beginning.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h2><a name="installing" class="anchorLink">Installing the downloaded packages</a></h2>
					<p>Well, you have downloaded a package, and you ask yourself "And now what?". This will depend on what Jabber client are you using, although it's possible that you must copy the package in a specific directory of the client and configure it to use the new package.</p>
					<p>Here are links to the detailed instructions for some clients:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="howtoPsi.html">Psi</a></li>
					</ul>

				<div class="section">
					<h2><a name="contributing" class="anchorLink">Contributing to J.E.D.I.</a></h2>
					<p>So, do you want to contribute? Great! There're a lot of things you could do: a better webpage style (yes, I know it sucks... :P ), add new features, improve the code and the documentation, the project page... In fact, everything can be improved ;)</p>
					<p>Please, go to the <a href="http://jedi.berlios.de">J.E.D.I. project page</a>, where you could find more information about the development and how to contribute.</p>
